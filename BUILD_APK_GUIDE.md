# SwiftSell AI - Android APK Build Guide

## ✅ Setup Complete!

Your React app has been successfully configured with Capacitor for Android development!

## 📱 Building Your APK

### Method 1: Using Android Studio (Recommended)

1. **Android Studio should be opening automatically** from the previous command
   - If not, manually open Android Studio
   - Open the project folder: `x:\swiftsell-ai\android`

2. **Wait for Gradle sync** to complete (this may take a few minutes on first run)

3. **Build APK:**
   - Go to `Build` → `Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)` → `Build APK(s)`
   - Or use the shortcut: `Ctrl + Shift + A` and search "Build APK"

4. **Find your APK:**
   - Location: `android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`
   - Android Studio will show a notification with "locate" link when build completes

### Method 2: Command Line Build (Alternative)

If Android Studio doesn't work, you can build via command line:

```bash
# Navigate to android folder
cd android

# Build debug APK
.\gradlew assembleDebug

# Build release APK (for production)
.\gradlew assembleRelease
```

## 📲 Installing the APK

### On Your Android Device:

1. **Enable Developer Options:**
   - Go to Settings → About Phone
   - Tap "Build Number" 7 times
   - Go back to Settings → Developer Options
   - Enable "USB Debugging" and "Install via USB"

2. **Install APK:**
   - Transfer the APK file to your device
   - Open file manager and tap the APK
   - Allow "Install from Unknown Sources" if prompted
   - Install the app

## 🔄 Development Workflow

When you make changes to your React app:

```bash
# 1. Build your React app
npm run build

# 2. Sync changes to Android
npx cap sync

# 3. Rebuild APK in Android Studio or via command line
```
